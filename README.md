**Advanced Implementation of Restaurants Database Management System**

This project was undertaken as part with the primary objective of demonstrating a deep understanding of database design and development processes. The project involved conceptualizing a sample application requiring complex data interactions, designing its database using ERD in Crowâ€™s Foot Notation, and implementing the database with Python scripts, ensuring adherence to normalization principles.The system was developed to manage various aspects of restaurants, including cuisine types, user feedback, and restaurant details. The primary objective was to demonstrate an in-depth understanding of database design and development processes, with a focus on Python and SQL integration using Flask and PyMySQL.

Project Duration:
September 2023 - December 2023

**Project Objectives:**

To design and implement a multi-table database for a restaurant application with complex data relationships.
To ensure secure user authentication and image upload capabilities for restaurant listings.
To apply advanced database design principles to create an efficient, normalized database structure.
To implement the database and perform various operations using Python scripts, ensuring adherence to normalization principles.

**Tasks and Methodologies:**

Database Design and Initialization:
Designed a database with four primary tables: Cuisine, User, Restaurant, and Feedback, ensuring each table was related to at least one other.
Implemented a Python script to initialize the database and tables, handling connections and executing SQL queries using PyMySQL.

**Secure User Authentication:**
Developed a user authentication system requiring a username and password. Passwords are hashed and salted using bcrypt for security.

**Image Upload Capability:**
Enabled restaurants to have associated images by storing image paths in the Restaurant table, allowing for easy retrieval and display.

**Python Script Implementation:**
Created a Flask web application to interact with the database.
Implemented Python functions for inserting and removing data from each table, ensuring data integrity and type validation.
Developed additional functionalities, including updating user passwords, calculating average restaurant ratings, and user profile retrieval.

**Testing and Validation:**
Conducted comprehensive testing for all functionalities, including normal use and edge cases, ensuring the system's reliability and effectiveness.

**Project Outcomes:**
Successfully designed and implemented a fully functional database management system for the Peterborough Restaurants application.
Ensured the database adhered to advanced design principles, optimizing for efficiency and integrity.
Developed a Python-based web application capable of handling various database operations, enhancing the application's interactivity and user experience.
Validated the functionality and robustness of the database and script through meticulous testing.

**Technical Details:**
Flask Application: Utilized Flask to create a web application, serving as the interface for database interactions.
Database Connection: Established connections to a MySQL database using PyMySQL, handling errors and ensuring smooth operations.
Table Creation and Relationships: Defined tables for Cuisine, User, Restaurant, and Feedback with appropriate relationships and constraints.
Data Insertion and Removal: Implemented functions to insert and remove data, including validation checks and error handling.
Security Measures: Employed bcrypt to hash and salt passwords, ensuring user credentials are stored securely.
Additional Functionalities: Included functions for updating passwords, retrieving average ratings, and more, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of database operations.
Testing Framework: Developed a testing framework within the Flask application to ensure all functionalities perform as expected.

**Other Details:**
Compiled a detailed report outlining the project's objectives, methodologies, and outcomes.
Included the Python script (.py file) demonstrating the implementation of the database and operations.
Ensured all documentation was well-labeled and included personal identification details as required.

**Project Significance:**
This project not only solidified my understanding of complex database design and development concepts but also demonstrated my ability to apply these concepts in a practical, real-world scenario. The skills acquired and demonstrated through this project are directly applicable to numerous data management roles and tasks in the tech industry.
Ensured all documentation was well-labeled and included personal identification details as required.
